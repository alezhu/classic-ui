# Alezhu ClassicUI

<!-- Plugin description -->
Based on original [JetBrains ClassicUI Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24468-classic-ui).

**In difference from original plugin this one has no limits to version.**

Provides the classic JetBrains IDE look and feel, which was used before the introduction of <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/new-ui">New UI</a>.
Includes UI layout, 3 tool window stripes and icons for IDEs and plugins.
If you prefer the old-school layout and visual style, this plugin brings back that familiar look and feel.
